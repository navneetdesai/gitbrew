### Title and Description<br>- The title and description are clear and descriptive enough. They state that the pull request is for refactoring code and creating a requirements file. However, the `[Do not merge]` tag in the title should be explained in the description. Why should this PR not be merged? <br><br>### Code Review<br><br>#### line: 13<br>- Good practice: The change from assigning the `pd.read_csv` function to a variable and then returning it, to directly returning the function result is a good practice. It makes the code cleaner and more readable.<br><br>#### line: 48<br>- Potential bug: The refactored code `alphabet_prob[alphabet] += alphabet in alphabet_prob` may not work as expected. The expression `alphabet in alphabet_prob` will return a boolean (True if `alphabet` is in `alphabet_prob` and False otherwise). This boolean will be implicitly cast to an integer (1 for True, 0 for False) when used in addition, which may not be the desired behavior. The original code incremented the count of `alphabet` in `alphabet_prob` by 1 if it was present, and this refactored code does not replicate that behavior.<br><br>#### line: 48<br>- Best practice: The use of `set` to keep track of unique alphabets in a word is a good practice. It helps in reducing the complexity of the code.<br><br>#### line: 65<br>- Good practice: The removal of the unused `word_dict` variable is a good practice. It helps in making the code cleaner and more efficient.<br><br>### Readability<br>- The code is generally readable with good use of function and variable names. However, it could benefit from more comments explaining the logic, especially for complex lines like `alphabet_prob[alphabet] += alphabet in alphabet_prob`.'
